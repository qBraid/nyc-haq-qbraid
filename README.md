# qBraid Challenge: Quantum Portfolio Optimization

## Why Think About Finance?

In light of recent financial events, like the **Fed rate cuts of 50 basis points**, the impact on finance is more apparent than ever. Some of the most successful **Super Investors** have built fortunes by owning just a few carefully selected stocks while managing billions of dollars. 

### Notable Super Investors:
- **Bill Ackman**: Pershing Square Capital Management [Portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/pershing-square-capital-management-l-p)
- **Dev Kantesaria**: Valley Forge Capital Management [Portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/valley-forge-advisors-llc)
- **Chris Hohn**: TCI Fund Management [Portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/childrens-investment-fund-management-uk-llp)

### Key Insights:
- **Selective Portfolios**: Super investors often hold only a few stocks in their portfolios. This goes against the traditional idea of needing many diversified holdings to minimize risk.
- **Concentration**: By focusing on just a few companies, these investors are betting on their deep research and understanding of the underlying business fundamentals.
- **Active Management**: Most of these investors take an active role in managing their portfolios, continuously adjusting based on the financial and macroeconomic environment.

## Challenges of Managing a Select Few Stocks
1. **Volatility Risk**:
   - Fewer stocks mean **higher exposure** to each stock's price movement.
   - The **volatility** of a single stock can significantly impact the overall portfolio.
   
2. **Stock-Specific Risk**:
   - Poor performance by one stock could lead to large losses, as diversification is limited.
   - **Business fundamentals** must be thoroughly understood to mitigate this risk.

3. **Market Timing**:
   - These investors often look for **undervalued stocks** or special situations that they believe will yield outsized returns.
   - **Timing the market** effectively is crucial, as concentrated portfolios can underperform during certain periods.

## Factors to Consider When Managing a Concentrated Portfolio
1. **Economic Conditions**:
   - Understand how **Fed interest rates**, inflation, and broader economic factors impact the industries of the selected companies.
   
2. **Business Fundamentals**:
   - Focus on **profitability, revenue growth, management quality**, and **industry position** of the companies.
   - Look at **long-term trends** rather than short-term market movements.

3. **Competitive Moats**:
   - Companies with **strong competitive advantages** (moats) are more likely to succeed in the long term.
   - Consider factors like **brand strength, intellectual property, network effects**, and **customer loyalty**.

4. **Valuation Metrics**:
   - Use metrics like **Price-to-Earnings (P/E)** ratio, **Price-to-Book (P/B)** ratio, **Free Cash Flow**, and **Return on Equity (ROE)** to ensure you're not overpaying for a stock.

5. **Macroeconomic Trends**:
   - Stay informed about **macroeconomic shifts** such as Fed rate changes, which affect credit markets, consumer spending, and corporate earnings.

# qBraid Challenge: Quantum Portfolio Optimization

In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, the ability to optimize investment portfolios efficiently and effectively is more crucial than ever. As classical computing approaches the limits of Moore's Law, quantum computing emerges as a revolutionary technology with the potential to transform the field of financial optimization.

This hackathon challenges you to dive into the exciting intersection of quantum computing and financial technology. You'll explore how quantum algorithms can be applied to solve complex portfolio optimization problems, potentially outperforming classical methods in both speed and accuracy.

Over the course of three increasingly complex tiers, you'll implement portfolio optimization algorithms using different quantum computing paradigms, from quantum annealing to gate-based models. You'll then demonstrate the practical advantages of these quantum approaches by applying them to real-world portfolio data.

This challenge is not just about coding; it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in financial optimization. You'll be at the forefront of a technological revolution, working with cutting-edge quantum technologies that have the potential to reshape the financial industry.

Whether you're a quantum computing enthusiast, a fintech innovator, or simply curious about the future of technology in finance, this challenge offers a unique opportunity to develop skills that are highly sought after in both the quantum and financial sectors.

Are you ready to take a quantum leap into the future of portfolio optimization? Let's begin this exciting journey into the quantum realm of finance!

## Challenge Requirements

You will be evaluated based on how far you reach in the provided tiers. For more details, read the Judging Criteria section below. If you have any questions about the tiers, please ask us. You will have the option to run all of your code on quantum simulators before you do a final run on actual hardware via qBraid!

### Tier 1: Gate-based Quantum Portfolio Optimization

Develop a portfolio optimization algorithm using a gate-based quantum computing model. Your objectives are to:

1. Implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for portfolio optimization.
2. Use a quantum circuit simulator or a real quantum device through a cloud service.
3. Optimize a medium-sized portfolio (e.g., 20-50 assets).

Refer to the paper "Best practices for portfolio optimization by quantum computing" published in Nature [2]. This study provides insights into using VQE for portfolio optimization, including guidance on selecting appropriate hyperparameters and quantum circuits. You can also draw from "Approaching Mean Variance Efficiency for Large Portfolios", published by NYU Stern [7] to gain inspiration for your encoding.

*You are encouraged to use simulators for this step.*

### Tier 2: Algorithm Hardware Optimization

Improve your algorithm so that it is optimized for execution on actual hardware.

1. Utilize intelligent transpilation via Qiskit or any other package to ensure that your circuit is mapped more accurately to the qubits.
2. Pick a particular quantum computing backend and determine the most effective way to map your circuit to that topology.
3. Demonstrate that your optimized circuit runs on the hardware better than the naive circuit you developed in Tier 1.

You can read the [IBM Quantum Documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/qiskit-transpiler-service) on transpilers for quantum circuits to get started on your path to optimization and developing hardware-specific efficiency. From there, feel free to implement your own optimization strategies!

*You are encouraged to use hardware for this step.*

### Tier 3: Performance Evaluation and Computational Cost Reduction

Demonstrate the effectiveness of your quantum algorithms by:

1. Running both the naive and optimized algorithms on sample portfolios of increasing sizes.
2. Comparing the performance and computational costs against classical optimization methods.
3. Analyzing and visualizing the results to show any reduction in computational cost or improvement in solution quality.

For this tier, you can draw insights from the paper "Exploring the synergistic potential of quantum annealing and gate model computing for portfolio optimization" by Jain et al. [4]. This study presents a hybrid approach combining quantum annealing and gate-based methods for large-scale portfolio optimization problems. Even though we are not using quantum annealers in this challenge, this should serve as a good benchmark for how much your solution should improve upon classical methods.

- Creative applications of the optimizer to other financial problems

Each team will be evaluated based on these criteria, with the final score determining the challenge winners. Completing all three tiers is **not** a requirementâ€”we will evaluate you on how well you execute each tier. A team that does a haphazard job completing all three tiers will not necessarily do better than a team that executes one or two tiers perfectly.

Most importantly, remember to have fun! The qBraid Team will be here for you as you develop your solutions.

Good luck to all participants!
